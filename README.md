# Logistic Regression using TeleCommunication-Customer-Churn-DataSet

Customer churn is when a business loses its clients or customers. To keep costs low, businesses focus on retaining existing customers rather than acquiring new ones. This is why customer churn rates are important business metrics. To address customer churn, businesses have customer service departments which work to win back customers who have left. This is because customers who have been with a company for a long time can be worth more than new customers.
